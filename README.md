# Philadlephia Eagles Memory Match
Being from the Philadelphia area made doing a project around the Philadelphia Eagles a no brainier, especially after we won the Super Bowl in 2018! This project utilizes HTML5, JavaScriptand CSS to bring to life a Philadelphia Eagles themed memory match game. Thisproject was a lot of fun to build. Upon loading the images shuffle to different places for each game so there is always a different experience. This particularÂ application got a lot of use in my house, and some brownie points with my son which is always a plus. E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES!!
